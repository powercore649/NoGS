# NoGS
 Chrome Extension that ensures you are connected to a VPN before going to blocked sites.

# Why?
 A friend of mine kept forgetting to connect a VPN before going to less than shady webistes (I don't ask question, I just write programs). He asked if there was a way to block going to particular sites unless you are using a VPN, I looked around and couldn't find anything so I decided to write this Chrome Extension.

# How?
